## Option 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages (Free)

1. **Add homepage to package.json:**

   {
     "homepage": "https://yourusername.github.io/your-repo-name"
   }
   ```

2. **Install gh-pages:**

## Option 4: Use ngrok for Temporary Access (Development)

If you want to quickly share your local development server:

1. **Install ngrok:**
   ```bash
   npm install -g ngrok
   ```

2. **Start your development server:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

3. **In another terminal, expose your local server:**
   ```bash
   ngrok http 3000
   ```

4. **Share the ngrok URL** (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`) with anyone

## Quick Start Recommendation

For the fastest deployment, I recommend **Netlify**:
1. Go to https://netlify.com
2. Sign up for free
3. Drag your `build` folder to the deployment area
4. Your app is live! ðŸŽ‰

## Local Network Access

If you want to access your app from other devices on your local network:

1. **Find your computer's IP address:**
   ```bash
   ipconfig
   ```
   Look for your IPv4 address (usually starts with 192.168.x.x or 10.0.x.x)

2. **Access from other devices:**
   - From your phone/tablet, go to: `http://YOUR_IP_ADDRESS:3000`
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:3000`

**Note:** This only works when your development server is running and devices are on the same WiFi network.
